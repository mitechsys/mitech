title: Bait Packaging System
layout: project
text: This system was developed to support a commercial fish bait wholesalerâ€™s packaging needs. It automatically adds dirt, water, lid, and label to plastic bait containers. Dirt can be loaded into a bulk hopper with a skid loader or by hand. The dirt fill system automatically measures volume to a user-adjustable level. The system supports multiple container/lid sizes and configurations.
