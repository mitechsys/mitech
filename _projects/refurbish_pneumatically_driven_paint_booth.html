title: Refurbish Pneumatically Driven Paint Booth
layout: project
---
<p>Project involved refurbishing a legacy paint booth with full pneumatical control and sequencing. Minimal documentation existed so a pneumatic schematic was generated and the system debugged to identify failure points and restore it to production-ready operation.  Basic operating and setup instructions were generated to support customer maintenance personnel.</p>
