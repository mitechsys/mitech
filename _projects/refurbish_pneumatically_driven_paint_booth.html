title: Refurbish Pneumatically Driven Paint Booth
layout: project
text: This project involved refurbishing a legacy paint booth with full pneumatical control and sequencing. Minimal documentation existed so a pneumatic schematic was generated and the system was debugged to identify failure points and restore it to production-ready operation. Basic operating and setup instructions were generated to support customer maintenance personnel.
