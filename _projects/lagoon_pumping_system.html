text: Developed in close collaboration with the customer, this system provides stand-alone suction and pumping of lagoon-captured animal waste. It provides sufficient capacity and pressure output to support direct pumping for remote toolbar application. The system uses a high-horsepower engine with a driveline to a submerged waste pump. Custom front axle design supports tight turns when towing on the road. Mitech activities included 3-D CAD layout, drawing production, and extensive kinematic and structural analysis.
