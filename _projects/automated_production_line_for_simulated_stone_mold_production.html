title: Automated Production Line for Simulated Stone Mold Production
layout: project
areas: [Manufacturing equipment, New development and prototypes]
---
<p>Developed production line layout and component designs to support automated production of molds to replace fully manual production.  New line included cure ovens and intelligent conveyor system to shorten mold production time from weeks to less than 2 days.  Automation significantly reduced floor space usage and operator handling.</p>
