title: Marine Thruster System Design
layout: project
text: As part of an ongoing search and salvage operation, a pair of outboard hydraulic thrusters were redesigned and rebuilt to correct manufacturer design deficiencies in the fluid swivels and support bearings. Thrusters were  driven by twin, 500 hp diesel HPUs operating at 5000 psi. Redesign included from-scratch development of a new multi-pass fluid swivel and top-end support bearings to handle cantilevered lift of the thrusters.
