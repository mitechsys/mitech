title: High Temperature Oven Lift System
layout: project
text: This oven lift system was developed to handle 900-1000 degree F temperatures in an air oven. Lift system operates in an extremely dirty environment with all drive and actuation components located outside the oven. The lift allows the wheeled dolly to be removed from under the product cart during the heating cycle to avoid damaging wheel bearings and wheels. Carts can weigh up to 4000 lb.
