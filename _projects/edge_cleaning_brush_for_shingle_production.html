title: Edge Cleaning Brush for Shingle Production
layout: project
text: As part of roofing shingle production, a continuous belt of substrate has asphalt and gravel applied to various bands across its width.  Itâ€™s critical that certain strips are clean so adhesive can be applied to what will become the adhesive strips once the die cut pieces are assembled.  Mitech developed an add-on edge cleaning system that uses a pair of driven wire wheels to remove residue from prior stages prior to adhesive application. Brushes are counterbalanced with adjustable down force to allow operators to tune process parameters.
