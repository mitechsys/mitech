title: Sheet Feed System
layout: project
text: The sheet feed system was developed for reliable and accurate feeding of corrugated blanks for hot forming of food trays and containers. It is adjustable from 6-30‚Äù blank widths and can support multiple feed lines. The bottom-feed system supports refilling without press stoppage. Accuracy and consistency of the feeder allowed significant increases in throughput and reduction of scrap. The system reliably feeds non-round blanks.
