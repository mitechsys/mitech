title: Laser Measuring and Inspection System
layout: project
text: Mitech took a partially developed design for a laser measuring system and reworked the design and parts to support the required accuracy and repeatability while still being serviceable. The system is capable of measuring with high accuracy, out of round, wall thickness variation, straightness, tube length, and end perpendicularity for a precision tubular product.  Two full systems were built, installed in a production line and tested for accuracy and repeatability.  Work was done in collaboration with a controls and software house.
