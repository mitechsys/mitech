title: Large Box Blank Feed and Gluing System Refurbishment
layout: project
text: This project involved rework of and older box assembly machine. Tasks included design and installation of a large surface lift platform for operator feeding of box blanks and an upgraded glue application system. Upgrades increased the box size which could be assembled as well as significantly improving glue application accuracy, reliability, and control. An extended adjustment rail and quick-adjust sensors were added to accommodate larger box sizes.
