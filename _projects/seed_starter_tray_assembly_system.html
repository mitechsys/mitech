title: Seed Starter Tray Assembly System
layout: project
text: This assembly machine takes multiple bulk-stacked components and assembles them into a finished product for consumer sales. It's configurable for multiple products with varying components. Feed stations can be continuously reloaded with bulk components for continuous operation. It includes feed-from-stack for the tray, a high-speed sheet feeder for the insert and lid components, and a stuffing system to package the assembly into the product sleeve. Mitech provided a turn-key system with 5-10X improvement in throughput.
