<p>Mitech has developed multiple magnet dispensing systems for manual operator picking as well as robotic hand-off.  Dispensing of high strength, rare earth magnets includes significant challenges. The system pictured supports single magnet feeding for operator placement as part of an automotive component assembly station.  System is fully pneumatic and incorporates a lockable fill hatch for quality control and traceability.</p>
