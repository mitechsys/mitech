title: Tie-Dye Prep Machine
layout: project
text: This system was designed to do garment preparation of for tie-dying. The system replaced much slower, manual operations and supports a 4-6X improvement in throughput. Operators load variable sized garments and the system automatically forms and ties a “puck” which can then be used for numerous dye/paint processes. Other wrap and tie processes are also available as well as less automated versions.
