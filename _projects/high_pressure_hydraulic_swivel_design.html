layout: project
---
<p>Multiple high pressure hydraulic fluid swivels have been designed and built for specific, custom applications. Working pressures up to 6000 psi with continuous rotation capability are common. Operating environments include sub-sea and harsh environment marine and industrial applications. Some designs included custom seal designs to meet specific performance and size requirements. Photo included is for a fly-away thruster system for an amphibious aircraft.</p>
