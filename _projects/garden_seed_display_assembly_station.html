title: Garden Seed Display Assembly station
layout: project
text: This purpose-built assembly station replaces fully manual operator assembly of multi-part garden seed displays. The operator loads individual components into the machine which then forms the components to support snap-together features. The machine significantly reduces operator variability and fatigue while also increasing throughput. The unit is fully pneumatic and requires no electrical connection.
