title: Cartridge Filling System
layout: project
text: This system was developed to support cartridge filling of high value batch potting and sealing compounds. Individual fill stations allow operators to simultaneously fill multiple cartridges. Quick load features allow operators to minimize repetitive motions and be extremely quick at cartridge changes, maximizing throughput. The automatic fill cycle can be adjusted to repeatedly fill with high accuracy. The system is adaptable to a wide range of cartridge sizes and configurations. The fill base can be configured to accommodate multiple mixing pot sizes and a variable number of fill stations as well a dual-sided filling to support 2-operator operation. Plumbing can be configured to support high viscosity materials.
