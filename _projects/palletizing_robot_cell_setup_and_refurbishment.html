title: Palletizing Robot Cell Setup and Refurbishment
layout: project
text: "This customer-owned robot cell had been warehoused for some time. Mitech worked with minimal documentation to reassemble the robot, conveyor systems, and safety enclosure. Work included: component repair and rebuild, programming deciphering and rework, and development of an accurate system electrical schematic. The system was reconfigured to support the customerâ€™s current needs. Mitech also provided ongoing maintenance support and new operator training."
