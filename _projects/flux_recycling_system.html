title: Flux Recycling System
layout: project
text: As part of a welding product production process, a system was designed and built to recycle excess powdered flux. These systems were retrofitted onto two existing production lines and included large input hopper and flexible screw augers to move material to an over-head feed hopper.  Vibratory feeders were used to help move material.
