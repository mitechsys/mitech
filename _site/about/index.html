    <h1>About</h1>
<p>Located in Central Ohio, Mitech has provided engineering, design, and product development for clients throughout the Midwest and continental United States for over 30 years. They specialize in practical, nuts-and-bolts engineering solutions for new products and custom equipment for a wide range of clients and industries. They're also skilled at redesigning and retooling existing hardware that isn’t performing or is simply outdated. Their products are designed to be operator friendly and durable.</p>
<p>Company President Mike Milosh has a lifetime of experience solving problems and making things work. Growing up on the family farm in northern Michigan, he learned to operate and maintain farm equipment as well as service and rebuild equipment for other farmers in the area. He spent 14 years working in the Equipment Development group of a major research and development firm in Columbus and subsequently spent several years designing, building, and operating marine and ROV equipment as the Technical Director for the Columbus America Discovery Project. There he led a diverse team and completed three successful seasons at sea while conducting underwater operations to recover over 3 tons of gold and artifacts from the 1857 shipwreck of the SS Central America. Since forming Mitech, Mr. Milosh has continued to address challenging engineering problems and holds multiple patents as a result.</p>
<p>Mr. Milosh has built a cohesive team within Mitech as well as a network of subcontractors and vendors. As a result, they regularly tackle problems other firms have been unsuccessful at or are unwilling to take on and have develop proprietary and novel systems that provide dramatic improvements in productivity and reliability for their clients. They are adept at the process of turning an idea into useable, functioning hardware. Using state-of-the-art 3D CAD modeling and analysis software, they create virtual copies of their designs to share with clients and to pre-check fit and function before committing to full-scale hardware. Their in-house prototyping and fabrication facilities allow them to test ideas early and quickly produce finished hardware.</p>
<p>If you're interested in working with a firm that will listen and work with you to arrive at a solution, Mitech is the company you should be talking with.</p>
