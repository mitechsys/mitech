<h1>About</h1>
<p>Mitech Systems, Ltd. was established in 1995 by Mike Milosh. A Graduate of Michigan Technological University's Mechanical Engineering program, Mike spent over 13 years working in the Equipment Development Group of a major research and development firm in Columbus, Ohio. He holds multiple patents.</p>
<p>Mike also spent several years designing, building, and operating marine and ROV equipment as the technical director of the Columbus America Discovery Project and spent three seasons at sea conducting underwater recovery operations.</p>
<p>Growing up on a farm with access to a small machine and welding shop, Mike enjoyed inventing and repairing equipment. With the nearest farm supply store 45 miles away, he learned to keep equipment running when parts weren't readily at hand.</p>
<p>With this background, Mike has developed a deep knowledge of machine design principles and has the experience to provide practical insight into a wide variety of design problems.</p>
